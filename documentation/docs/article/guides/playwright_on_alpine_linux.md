# Playwright on Alpine Linux

**NOTE: This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.**

Playwright actually requires a permission for shell command execution, and many run-time dependencies for each browser.

![all-in-one](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11763113/124934388-9c9c9100-e03f-11eb-8f13-324afac3be2a.png)

This all-in-one architecture is reasonable for browser automation in our own computers.

However we may have trouble with bringing Playwright into:

- Docker
  - Alpine Linux
- Serverless computing
  - AWS Lambda
  - Google Cloud Functions
- PaaS
  - Heroku
  - Google App Engine

This article introduces a way to separate environments into client (for executing Playwright script) and server (for working with browsers). The main use-case assumes Docker (using Alpine Linux), however the way can be applied also into other use-cases.

## Overview

Playwright Ruby client is running on Alpine Linux. It just sends/receives JSON messages of Playwright-protocol via WebSocket.

Playwright server is running on a container of [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright). It just operates browsers in response to the JSON messages from WebSocket.

### Playwright Server v.s. Browser Server

Playwright provides two kind of methods to share the browser environments for clients.

When you want to share only one browser environment, Browser server is suitable. This feature is officially supported in Playwright.

- Server can be launched with [BrowserType#launchServer](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-server) instead of `BrowserType#launch`.
- Client can connect to server with [BrowserType#connect](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-connect). In playwright-ruby-client, `BrowserType#connect` and not implemented yet and use `Playwright#connect_to_browser_server()` instead.

Another method is sharing all browser environment. This method is very simple, but not an official feature, and can be changed in future.

- Server can be launched with `playwright run-server` (CLI command).
- Client can connect to server with `Playwright.connect_to_playwright_server` instead of `Playwright.create`

## Playwright server/client

:::caution

This method is no longer supported on Playwright driver >= 1.35. See [this issue](https://github.com/YusukeIwaki/playwright-ruby-client/issues/254) for detail, and use Browser server/client method instead.

:::

### Client code

Many example uses `Playwright#create`, which internally uses Pipe (stdin/stdout) transport for Playwright-protocol messaging. Instead, **just use `Playwright#connect_to_playwright_server(endpoint)`** for WebSocket transport.

```ruby {3}
require 'playwright'

Playwright.connect_to_playwright_server('wss://example.com:8888/ws') do |playwright|
  playwright.chromium.launch do |browser|
    page = browser.new_page
    page.goto('https://github.com/microsoft/playwright')
    page.screenshot(path: 'github-microsoft-playwright.png')
  end
end
```

`wss://example.com:8888/ws` is an example of endpoint URL of the Playwright server. In local development environment, it is typically `"ws://127.0.0.1:#{port}/ws"`.

### Server code

With the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright) or in the local development environment with Node.js, just execute `npx playwright install && npx playwright run-server --port $PORT --path /ws`. (`$PORT` is a port number of the server)

If custom Docker image is preferred, build it as follows:

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright

WORKDIR /root
RUN npm install playwright && ./node_modules/.bin/playwright install

ENV PORT 8888
CMD ["./node_modules/.bin/playwright", "run-server", "--port", "$PORT", "--path", "/ws"]
```

## Browser server/client

### Client code

Use `Playwright#connect_to_playwright_server` and pass the WebSocket URL for browser server.
Note that this method requires a block with `Browser`, not `Playwright` or `BrowserType`.

```ruby
Playwright.connect_to_playwright_server(ws_url) do |browser|
  page = browser.new_page
  page.goto(...)
  ...
end
```

### Server code

For instant use, `npx playwright launch-server --browser chromium` generates a WebSocket endpoint URL with a random path.

More customization can be done by implementing JavaScript server like below:

```js
const playwright = require("playwright");

option = {
  channel: "chrome-canary",
  headless: false,
  port: 8080,
  wsPath: "ws",
};
playwright.chromium.launchServer(option).then((server) => {
  console.log(server.wsEndpoint());
});
```

`port` and `wsPath` would be useful for generating static WebSocket endpoint URL.
Other available options for `BrowserType#launchServer` can be found here:
https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch-server

## Debugging for connection

The client and server are really quiet. This chapter shows how to check if the communication on the WebSocket works well or not.

### Show JSON message on client

Just set an environment variable `DEBUG=1`.

```
DEBUG=1 bundle exec ruby some-automation-with-playwright.rb
```

### Enable verbose logging on server

Just set an environment variable `DEBUG=pw:*` or `DEBUG=pw:server`

```
DEBUG=pw:* npx playwright launch-server --browser chromium
```

See [the official documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug/#verbose-api-logs) for details.
