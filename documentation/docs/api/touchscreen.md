# Touchscreen

The Touchscreen class operates in main-frame CSS pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport. Methods on the
touchscreen can only be used in browser contexts that have been initialized with `hasTouch` set to true.

## tap_point

```
def tap_point(x, y)
```

Dispatches a `touchstart` and `touchend` event with a single touch at the position (`x`,`y`).
