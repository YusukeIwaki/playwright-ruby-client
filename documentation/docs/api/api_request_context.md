# APIRequestContext

This API is used for the Web API testing. You can use it to trigger API endpoints, configure micro-services, prepare
environment or the service to your e2e test. When used on [Page](./page) or a [BrowserContext](./browser_context), this API will automatically use
the cookies from the corresponding [BrowserContext](./browser_context). This means that if you log in using this API, your e2e test will be
logged in and vice versa.

## delete

```
def delete(
      url,
      failOnStatusCode: nil,
      headers: nil,
      ignoreHTTPSErrors: nil,
      params: nil,
      timeout: nil)
```

Sends HTTP(S) [DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE) request and returns its
response. The method will populate request cookies from the context and update context cookies from the response. The
method will automatically follow redirects.

## dispose

```
def dispose
```

All responses returned by [APIRequestContext#get](./api_request_context#get) and similar methods are stored in the memory, so that you
can later call [APIResponse#body](./api_response#body). This method discards all stored responses, and makes
[APIResponse#body](./api_response#body) throw "Response disposed" error.
